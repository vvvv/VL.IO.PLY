## Using the library
In order to use this library you'll have to install the nuget that is available via nuget.org. For information on how to use nugets with VL, see [Managing Nugets](https://thegraybook.vvvv.org/reference/hde/managing-nugets.html) in the documentation. As described there you go to the commandline and then type:

    nuget install VL.IO.PLY -pre

Once the VL.IO.PLY nuget is installed and referenced in your VL document you'll see the category "IO.NDI" in the nodebrowser. Press F1 to open the Help Browser and search for the term "ply" to see relevant how-to patches.
